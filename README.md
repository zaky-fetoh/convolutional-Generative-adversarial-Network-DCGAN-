# convolutional-Generative-adversarial-Network--DCGAN-
 deep convolutional Generative adversarial Network 
 ## The generator architecture:
 ![fig_generator](https://github.com/zaky-fetoh/convolutional-Generative-adversarial-Network-DCGAN-/blob/main/imgs/generator.png) 
 as shown on the diagram it consist of a three convolutional layers. last convolutional layer is used for masking. the hyperparameter as shown in the diagram
 ## The discriminator architecture:
 ![fig_dicriminator](https://github.com/zaky-fetoh/convolutional-Generative-adversarial-Network-DCGAN-/blob/main/imgs/discriminator.png) 
 as shown in the diagram it consist of three convilutional layers responsible for feature extraction
 ## complete GAN architecture:
 ![fig_gan](https://github.com/zaky-fetoh/convolutional-Generative-adversarial-Network-DCGAN-/blob/main/imgs/gan.png) 
 concatenation both generator and discriminator architectures results on GAN 
 ## GAN training :
 GAN training is done through two phases 
 1) discriminator is trained using real image come from the dataset and the fake images generated by the generator discrimimator learn to distenguishs between them.
 2) generator is trained to maximize the discriminator loss
 ## Result:
 here is the final Result shown in the figure 25 generated mnist image
